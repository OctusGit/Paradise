	This would cause the company to experiment and produce a weapon to fit between Shellguard's own disabler, and LG series weapons. This led to the creation of the EG series, positioning the EG-7 as a flagship model intended to eventually replace Shellguard's disabler pistols and LG series weapons. \
	Its design is an evolution of the disabler pistol frame, featuring a rotating lens within its firing chamber to toggle between non-lethal and lethal shots. \
	Further modifications include an extension of the weapon's length, using elements from the LG series, and a transition to carbon composites for a sleeker, modern look. \
	This design shift would evolve Shellguardâ€™s traditional military style, aligning more with the aesthetics preferred by corporations which value clean, sharp, and modern looking weapons. \
	In modern times, the EG-3 is staple weapon among corporate security forces. Due to its cheapness in price, dual fire modes, and modability for customization, despite Shellguard's disclaimer that tampering with the weapon void's its warranty and can potentially damage the gun itself."

	Just like the antique laser that inspired it, the X-01 is a testbed for the latest advances in energy weapon technology. \
	It manages to combine the functions of a disabler, laser, and ion gun into a single pistol-sized package using a unique hybrid optical-electromagnetic projection assembly that can seamlessly transition between the weapon's different firing modes. \
	This assembly is also excruciatingly difficult to manufacture - even the slightest deviation from the design's demanding tolerances results in a non-functional paperweight. Nonetheless, the promises of compact versatility it brings has kept the X-01 project's finances flowing for now. \
	Unfortunately, the micro-fission reactor used to self-charge the power cell of the antique gun could not be replicated, and so this feature is absent in the X-01's current design. Continued research into the technology is ongoing. \
